        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>In today's hectic world who has time to schedule anything? Whether it be a simple get together with friends, a party, or an important meeting, 
            Schedule Us exists to make your scheduling process as easy as possible.</p>
        <p>Once you create an event in Schedule Us, our AI-assisted Event System will reach out to those you've invited and make the arrangements for you, taking into
           account the instructions you've given for event. Once the Event System has completed its job, you receive a text message stating that the event
           is confirmed.</p>
        <p>Schedule Us uses text messaging as its primary form of communciation, allowing for quick and easy replies to event nofications. In most cases,
            those you've invited will never even need to click on a link to confirm that they are attending. They just need to reply with the letter "Y" if
            they can make it or "N" if they can't.</p>
        <p>When the event organizer permits it, our system allows for invitees to suggest different times and locations for events. The Event
            System will take into account their needs to come up with the best time and place for your event - so you don't have to. There is no longer a need to message six different people or
            sift through long group texts. Everything happens out of your view while you wait.</p>
        <p>Schedule Us is also capable of storing recurring events and then rescheduling them routinely. Have a regular get-together with friends that you 
            can never seem to get on a calendar? Let Schedule Us schedule that for you so that you know it will happen.</p>
        <p>Our software is designed to work with different calendar platforms to gather as much data as possible as to the availability of your invitees. When
            all invitees have integrated their calendars, the system can seamlessly find the best time for events. This is especially valuable for scheduling
            recurring events.</p>
        <p>Even if you don't have an event but you just want to hang out, use Schedule Us to find something to do locally and then invite your friends.</p>
