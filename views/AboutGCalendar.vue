        <div class="mt-2">

        <b>What do I gain by integrating my Google calendar?</b> 
        </div>

        <div class="mt-2">
        1. Schedule Us may access your Google calendar to help find the best dates and times for events that you create or participate in through Schedule Us. Calendar access allows us to see when you have events already scheduled, so that we do not schedule the event at at date/time you are already scheduled. 
        </div>
        <div class="mt-2">
        2. Schedule Us can optionally put events that you create with Schedule Us on your Google calendar for you. 
        </div>

        <div class="mt-3">
        <b>What data does Schedule Us access/store?</b>
